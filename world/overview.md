World Overview
==============

Fantasy environments, reflecting proximate astrophysical conditions near gateways. 
Far from gateways, conditions reflect crew whimsy and artistic flair.

As the seed-point of the British Node, the entry point is at the centre of a circle connecting Home capitals,
all of which is forest.

This enters a larger ring connecting Earth imperial capitals, each with environments related to the local environment.

Then, there is a linear path connecting to planets, with fantastic environments.

Then, there is a wholly fantastic circle connecting to lines and rings leading to other gifted society homes.

Distances are roughly logarithmic relative to real world, subject to crew whimsy.

Home capitals:

Home ring is roughly a three days march around (75 miles). 
Centre of ring is a farmable bowl, a day's walk (25 miles) across.

* Bristol
* Cardiff
* Manchester
* Edinburgh
* Dublin

Earth capitals

Earth ring is roughly a month's march around (750 miles).

* Gibraltar
* Cairo (on a Middle East ring)
* Toronto (on a North American ring -- the U.S. is somehow difficult)
* Cape Town (on an African ring)
* Sidney (on an Australasia ring)
* (Carribean ring)
* Singapore (on an East Asia ring)
* Mumbai (on a South Asia ring)

A Europe Ring is a potential on the world ring, currently undefined and barren.

System

System ring is roughly a year's walk to pluto. (10000 miles) (25 days driving)
Mars is about a day's drive. (400 miles)

Moon, Mars, Asteroids, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter System, Saturn System...


The Crew
========

Crew are superusers of the space inside the gate. 
Each has specific areas they built, and certain attitudes to how recipients of gifts are to be tested and rewarded.
The Star-River Concord shares the view that individuals and civilisations should be rewarded according to
dynamism and creativity, but the areas that individual crewmembers particularly value vary.

Known crew of the Invented Chronicle:

* Captain -- Organisation, structure, teamwork.
* Engineer -- Reliability, constructiveness, technology.
* Quartermaster -- Abundance, opulence, trade, growth.
* Navigator -- Exploration, discovery, inventiveness.
* Relations -- Society, friendship, talking.
* Security -- Power, struggle, victory, resilience.

Each crewmember has left a significant AI representations of themselves in 
priviledged connected worlds at various points in the network. A navigator AI resides in most gates.

The Gremlins
============

The Invented Chronicle is an old ship, and has some problems in its world-building engines. These manifest as bugs
in created worlds, relating to each of the Crew. Some Bugs have manifested in subroutine worldlets.
