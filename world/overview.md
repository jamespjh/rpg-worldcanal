World Overview
==============

Fantasy environments, reflecting proximate astrophysical conditions near gateways. 
Far from gateways, conditions reflect crew whimsy and artistic flair.

As the seed-point of the British Node, the entry point is at the centre of a circle connecting Home capitals,
all of which is forest.

This enters a larger ring connecting Earth imperial capitals, each with environments related to the local environment.

Then, there is a linear path connecting to planets, with fantastic environments.

Then, there is a wholly fantastic circle connecting to lines and rings leading to other gifted society homes.

Distances are roughly logarithmic relative to real world, subject to crew whimsy.

Bristol
Cardiff
Manchester
Edinburgh
Dublin

The Crew
========

Crew are superusers of the space inside the gate. 
Each has specific areas they built, and certain attitudes to how recipients of gifts are to be tested and rewarded.
The Star-River Concord shares the view that individuals and civilisations should be rewarded according to
dynamism and creativity, but the areas that individual crewmembers particularly value vary.

Known crew of the Invented Chronicle:

Captain -- Organisation, structure, teamwork.
Engineer -- Reliability, constructiveness, technology.
Quartermaster -- Abundance, opulence, trade, growth.
Navigator -- Exploration, discovery, inventiveness.
Relations -- Society, friendship, talking.
Security -- Power, struggle, victory, resilience.
