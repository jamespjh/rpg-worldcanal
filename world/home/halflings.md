The Pobl
========

The Pobl are small humans, with caucasian skin color, african hair, and asian features.
They are about 4in shorter than 21st century humans, i.e. about 2in shorter than people of the C19th.

They are genetically capable of the same intelligence and
size as humans from the real world, but are underfed and culturally behind. There are about 250 of them.

Their history extends back 150 years, to the time the world was seeded. They are aware of the Crew, whom they
refer to as the Planters. The original 4 families represent four clans, the McEen, MacDee, MacTree, and MacPed.

Most do not have access rights to the inner gate, and none have access rights to the gates into the real world.

They are entirely artificial, and are not decended from humans.

If brought back to the real world in the company of those with appropiate access priviledges, 
they will under genetic ananalysis appear to be a human population with no obvious connections to any existing race.

They do not venture beyond the ring, except for a few famous individuals, the greatest of which was Eric MacDee,
who emptied out a very threatening band of miconids from inside the ring, broke an Eagle Eerie outside,
and then one day ventured through the centre ring. He returned a year and a day later bearing some magic items TBD.

Four individuals in history have gained escalated priviledges sufficient to go through the gate. (L3)
Eric Mac Dee, Mhairi Mac Dee, Iain Mac Een, and Shona Mac Ped. Shona Mac Ped is alive and very old. She remembers
reaching the great water, and speaking to the Men of the Sea. She has a ring of water breathing.

It is known that at least some escalated priviledges, which they refer to as being "Sung", 
are needed to access higher powers.

There are currently 25 L1 and 5 L2 Pobl. They have traditions extending from the four great songs, which these heros
follow.

Conner MacTree is the current Rie, Moira Mac Een the current Rianne.

Duncan Mac Ped is the commander of the guardpost they first meet.
