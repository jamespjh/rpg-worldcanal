The Lair of Jinny Angles
========================

Gwen Mac Een, Druid 3, was infected by a nasty spreading bug while investigating the Africa ring. 
Her lesser bug, Potato Blight, manifests as an appropriate demon. The defect is in the quartermaster's domain. 

Gwen has been able to harm the crops in the eastern
part of the inner ring: a dangerous priviledge escalation.

Her lair is surrounded by animated trees and fungi.

She has a gate to Potato Blight's domain, openable by any L4 privileges, 
anyone with anti-quartermaster alignment and L2. 
Potato Blight's domain has a gate to the domain of his master, Desertification,
but this requires v high level.
