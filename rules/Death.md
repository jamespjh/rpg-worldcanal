Death
=====

If you die, you may not renter for the lockout period for your death level.
If you die again within the danger period, you increase to the next lockout level.
The lockout lasts from when your body is returned to the real.
If your body is still within the canal world within the danger period, this counts as escalation.


Once your death level has raised (by deaths in succession), it cannot fall without Crew aid.
Level drain actually raises death levels. 
Raise Dead removes 1d3 death levels from someone currently in the canal, and cannot bring someone below level 3.
Resurrection removes 1 death level from someone in the real, 
or 1d6 from someone in the canal, and cannot bring below L2.
True Resurrection removes all death levels, real or not.

If a body is returned to the real, these cannot be removed without resurrection.
