Potential, Complexity, Resilience

Resilience is function of potential and complexity
Maximum complexity is function of potential

Different materials have different constitutive equations (how resilience effects mechanical behaviour.)
Different materials can use up potential in their algorithms to do different things

E.g.

Flesh:

Higher potential, lower resilience.
Moderate maximum complexity.
Springy (elastic): reslience is elastic coefficient.
Algorithms can change natural length by using up potential, in response to input signals or to external forces.

Fluid:

Higher potential, lower resilience.
High maximum complexity.
Resilience determines viscosity.
At low complexity, behaviour change is a more sudden phase transition (solid<->liquid)
At high complexity, becomes soft, like treacle or wax depending on the details of the code.

Energy types:

Electricity: Increasing potential
Cold: Decreasing potential
Positive: Increasing complexity
Negative: Decreasing complexity

Acid and Sonic damage are not energy types, they're physical manifestations of the use of potential.

Fire is contagious increase in potential, resulting from release of all potential when resilience drops to nil.
