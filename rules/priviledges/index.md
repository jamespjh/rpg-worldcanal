Enhanced access priviledges
===========================

Hero classes result from elevated priviledges to access the computational substrate of the canal world.

Ordinaries are per the D20 modern rules for those from the real world, or pathfinder experts etc for non-heroes
from the canal.

The first group of travellers from the real world in through the gate automatically gain Level 1 access priviledges.

Warriors use this to access higher compute allocations, resulting in faster reaction times.
Priests use this to communicate with the Crew, obtaining effects from the Crew's root privledges.
Rogues use this to gain access to the information of other entities in the system.
Magicians use this to manipulate the world.

Improved access privileges are granted to those who carry out some symbolic heroic act.

Level 1 access can only be gained by those who do something special.
Then, XP must be gained to reach L2 threshold. Another appropriate symbolic act must also occur.

Access to gates, to return from the canal into the real world, is subject to appropriate access privileges.

L1 for leaving the home ring by a seeded gate.
L2 for leaving the home ring and opening a new gate.
L3 to leave the home ring for the world ring.
L3 to leave the world ring and enter earth subrings.
L3 to leave earth subrings for the real world via an existing gate.
L4 to create a new world gate.
L4 to leave the world ring for the solar ring.
L4 to leave the solar ring to Luna (an existing gate).
L5 to leave the solar ring with a new gate?

Various levels for various other rings.
